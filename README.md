# Ex0

Assignment 0 +1  :

By: Moran Oshia 

In this program I worked in the package myMath which have a few class:
1. Cont_function
2. Function
3. Polynom_able
4. Monom
5. Monom_Coperator
6. Polynom

The main idea of this program is to make a Polynom witch is an ArrayList of Monoms, and to make the functions that in the interfaces of the classes.
In Monom there are :Constructors, multiply, derivative etc.
And in Polynom there are : Constructors, multiply, derivative,area,root etc.

addision of Ex1 is the FunctionGraph with show the function and her extremum.
and in Polynom class the area under the X axis and the function.
